# Labelling Amazon Forests From Space

Used Convolutional Neural Networks to label satellite image chips with atmospheric conditions and various classes of land cover/land use.
<br>

The model is based on VGG16 Neural Network Architecture.


The Resulting algorithm can help the global community better understand where, how, and why deforestation happens all over the world - and ultimately how to respond.
